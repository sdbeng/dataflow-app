- Control flow gives us this ability to choose among outcomes based on what else is happening in the program.

### Boolean operators aren't just evaluated from left to right. 

Just like with arithmetic operators, there's an order of operations for boolean operators:

not is evaluated first;
and is evaluated next;
or is evaluated last.
For example, True or not False and False returns True. If this isn't clear, look at the Hint.

Parentheses () ensure your expressions are evaluated in the order you want. Anything in parentheses is evaluated as its own unit.
